# Eden PS5 Port Plan

## Scope

This plan targets PS5 homebrew built with `ps5-payload-sdk`. It does not port
the PS4/OpenOrbis frontend or inherit PS4 platform assumptions. PS4 work may be
used only as a behavioral reference after the equivalent PS5 contract has been
identified and tested independently.

The source baseline for this plan is Eden revision `612409c7ba`. The graphics
baseline is Vulkan-PS5 revision `6610cfd`, OpenAGC API 45, the matching
`openagc-psbc`, SDL2 2.30.12, and the pinned Mesa/Zink integration recorded in
the adjacent projects.

## Frontend decision

Use RmlUi for the production PS5 interface. Keep Dear ImGui optional and
limited to developer diagnostics.

The frontend is a hybrid of existing Eden architecture:

- Use `src/yuzu_cmd` as the native executable, boot-flow, input-subsystem, and
  emulation-lifecycle starting point.
- Use Android's navigation and screen workflows as the console-oriented UX
  reference. Do not port Kotlin, Android fragments, Android XML widgets, JNI,
  or `ANativeWindow` dependencies.
- Extract the useful lifecycle behavior from Android's `EmulationSession` into
  a PS5-native C++ controller.
- Use `frontend_common` and core APIs for configuration, content, firmware,
  mods, play time, profiles, and applet contracts.
- Do not port the Qt frontend. Its game models, workers, applets, and main
  window are coupled to Qt types, signals, models, and widgets, and pacbrew has
  no required Qt stack.

The pacbrew `ps5-payload-rmlui` recipe currently packages RmlUi 6.2 with SDL2,
FreeType, SDL2_image, and optional LuaJIT bindings. The package exists but must
still be built, installed into the active PS5 sysroot, and qualified on
hardware. Lua must remain optional; the first frontend must not require it.

## UI architecture

Add a `src/ps5` frontend rather than adding PS5 conditionals throughout Qt or
Android code. Its UI boundary should contain:

- `Ps5Application`: initialization, main loop, shutdown, and process verdict.
- `Ps5EmulationSession`: initialize, boot, pause, resume, stop, and teardown.
- `Ps5EmuWindow`: Eden `Core::Frontend::EmuWindow` implementation and
  framebuffer layout.
- `RmlSystemInterfacePs5`: time, logging, cursor/clipboard stubs, and safe
  unsupported behavior.
- `RmlFileInterfacePs5`: read-only packaged assets plus writable Eden user
  paths.
- `RmlRenderInterfaceVulkanPs5`: RmlUi geometry, textures, scissor, transforms,
  and frame submission through ordinary Vulkan APIs.
- `RmlInputPs5`: SDL2 controller, keyboard, and text input translated into
  RmlUi focus/navigation events.
- A small presentation model that exposes Eden data to RML documents without
  making core or frontend-common code depend on RmlUi.

The RmlUi renderer must use Eden's Vulkan instance/device/queue and the
Vulkan-PS5 swapchain. It must not create a second VideoOut implementation,
inspect firmware, use OpenAGC handles, or submit an independent native queue
stream. Launcher rendering and the in-game overlay must share the same Vulkan
ownership and bounded synchronization model.

## Reusable Eden components

| Need | Reuse | PS5 work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Emulator boot and shutdown | `src/yuzu_cmd/yuzu.cpp`, Android `EmulationSession` behavior | Remove CLI/Android assumptions and expose a PS5 session controller |
| Window contract | `Core::Frontend::EmuWindow`, SDL Vulkan window patterns | Add a PS5 window/surface path and Vulkan-PS5 WSI hookup |
| Configuration | `frontend_common::Config`, `Common::Settings` | Add PS5 config paths and RmlUi bindings |
| Content and firmware | `frontend_common` managers and Android native calls | Add controller-driven file selection and progress/error models |
| Game metadata | Core loader/VFS metadata paths | Add a non-Qt/non-Kotlin game-library model and icon cache |
| Input | `InputCommon::InputSubsystem`, SDL driver | Map PS5 SDL2 controller events and RmlUi navigation |
| Audio | `audio_core` sink interface | Implement or qualify a PS5 SDL2 audio sink |
| Applets | `core/frontend/applets` contracts | Implement RmlUi error, profile, controller, and software-keyboard applets first |
| Renderer | Eden Vulkan renderer and VMA | Link Vulkan-PS5 and add PS5 surface/entrypoint discovery |
| UI workflows | Android navigation graphs and settings taxonomy | Re-express them as RML/CSS documents and C++ presentation models |

## Required UI screens

Implement screens in this order:

1. First-run setup for user data, production keys, firmware, and game folders.
2. Game-library grid/list with icons, favorites, refresh, and launch.
3. Game information and per-game configuration.
4. Global system, CPU, renderer, audio, and controller settings.
5. Profile selection and profile management.
6. Shader-loading and boot progress with actionable errors.
7. In-game quick menu: resume, pause, settings, restart, and stop.
8. Software keyboard, controller configuration, and error applets.
9. Add-ons, updates/DLC, save management, Amiibo/cabinet, and other secondary
   workflows after the basic game loop is stable.

Web applets, multiplayer UI, updater, driver downloads, Discord integration,
and desktop-only utilities are initially disabled. Each returns a deliberate
unsupported result where Eden requires a frontend contract; none may silently
succeed.

## Platform work

### Build and dependencies

- Add an explicit Prospero/PS5 CMake platform. Do not masquerade as Android,
  Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenOrbis.
- Cross-build C++20 with ps5-payload-sdk libc++ and static/package-resolved
  dependencies.
- Disable Qt, SDL3, cubeb, RenderDoc, update checking, Discord, web services,
  Wi-Fi scanning, libusb, and host-only crash dump paths for the first target.
- Consume pacbrew packages for OpenAGC, openagc-psbc, Vulkan-PS5,
  Vulkan-Headers, SDL2, RmlUi, SDL2_image, FreeType, FFmpeg, OpenSSL, Boost,
  fmt, zstd, lz4, Opus, and other dependencies only as Eden reaches them.
- Add a pacbrew Eden package only after a reproducible standalone Prospero
  build exists.

### Runtime and OS abstraction

- Qualify x86-64 Dynarmic/Xbyak executable-memory allocation, protection
  changes, instruction-cache behavior, and teardown on PS5.
- Implement PS5 paths for host memory, fibers, TLS, threads, timing, signals or
  exceptions, filesystem roots, logging, sockets, and power/lifecycle events.
- Keep every wait bounded and ensure shutdown works after partial
  initialization, failed game load, and renderer failure.
- Avoid Android JNI, Linux procfs/udev, desktop environment, and PS4
  OpenOrbis-specific branches.

### Graphics

- Link Eden to Vulkan-PS5 through standard Vulkan entrypoints. No Eden code may
  include private OpenAGC headers or low-level GPU interfaces.
- Add the PS5 surface/native-window bridge and static/shared entrypoint lookup.
- Prove VMA allocation policies, shader compilation, pipeline cache, command
  recording, swapchain recreation, and clean object retirement with an actual
  Eden workload.
- Add Vulkan/OpenAGC capabilities only when required by a captured Eden call
  trace and supported with generic plus hardware tests.

## Vulkan-PS5 dependency status

The graphics foundation is usable but Vulkan-PS5 is not finished for Eden.

Completed evidence at the current baseline:

- The native migration audit has zero direct low-level calls.
- The strict pinned Mesa/Zink capability report has zero gaps and advertises
  Vulkan 1.2.
- The Eden startup profile reports zero extension, feature, limit, and queue
  gaps.
- SDL/EGL/Zink context creation, exact pixel readback, visible presentation,
  teardown, and immediate relaunch passed identical binaries on FW 5.500.008
  and FW 11.600.005.
- `VK_EXT_depth_clip_enable` is qualified on both endpoints without the former
  Zink warning.

Remaining work that can block real Eden games:

- Eden has no Prospero build, Vulkan surface creation, or Vulkan entrypoint
  integration yet.
- The ICD exposes a narrow format set relative to Eden's roughly 150
  guest-relevant format snapshot. Expand qualified uncompressed and BC
  formats. Keep D24, ASTC, ETC, and unsupported storage-image combinations
  honest until native support or conversion is implemented.
- Color clear, blit, depth/stencil clear, attachment clear, and resolve forms
  that lack native contracts intentionally fail closed. Implement the exact
  forms observed in Eden before enabling affected games.
- Run the broader native-only Vulkan feature sequence on FW 5.50 and the full
  advertised-feature endpoint sequence on FW 11.60; the Zink endpoint pass is
  not a substitute for complete driver qualification.
- Add targeted Vulkan CTS/deqp coverage and retain a non-conformant claim until
  that evidence supports otherwise.
- Exercise the real Eden renderer, shader cache, VMA use, presentation, game
  transitions, teardown, and immediate relaunch. A zero-gap startup probe does
  not prove game compatibility.

The older `Vulkan-PS5/analysis/eden-compatibility.md` revision matrix contains
stale pre-migration statements, including old direct-call and presentation
status. Refresh it against this Eden revision before treating its detailed
format/command inventory as a release gate.

## Milestones and gates

### P0: reproducible skeleton

- Cross-configure Eden for PS5 using installed pacbrew dependencies.
- Build a minimal ELF with Qt, Android, and SDL3 excluded.
- Initialize logging, paths, settings, SDL2 controller input, RmlUi, Vulkan,
  and clean teardown without booting a game.
- Add host-testable navigation and failure-cleanup tests.

### P1: launcher

- Render the setup flow and game library through RmlUi.
- Scan a configured directory, display metadata/icons, persist settings, and
  select a profile entirely with a controller.
- Pass repeated launch/exit and missing/corrupt asset failure gates.

### P2: renderer bring-up

- Boot a homebrew Switch application through Eden's Vulkan renderer.
- Capture the exact Vulkan calls and close only genuine general-purpose ICD
  gaps.
- Prove visible output, bounded waits, clean teardown, and immediate relaunch
  first on FW 5.50, then replay identical bytes on FW 11.60.

### P3: playable loop

- Add loading UI, quick menu, pause/resume/stop, controller configuration,
  audio, software keyboard, and error/profile applets.
- Run `2048.nro`, then a small representative game set covering textures,
  depth, compute, caches, save data, and restart.

### P4: packaging and longevity

- Package Eden and all pinned dependencies through pacbrew.
- Record ELF/library SHA-256 values and dependency revisions.
- Run a 30-minute game/launcher cycle, repeated game switching, teardown, and
  immediate relaunch on FW 5.50 and FW 11.60.
- Require no leaked processes, unbounded waits, validation errors, native
  lifetime failures, or increasing memory plateau.

## Immediate next slice

1. Refresh Vulkan-PS5's Eden compatibility inventory at revision
   `612409c7ba`, emphasizing formats and commands actually used during startup.
2. Add the PS5 CMake platform and a minimal `src/ps5` executable target.
3. Build and install the pacbrew RmlUi package, with Lua disabled unless a
   concrete UI requirement appears.
4. Bring up SDL2 controller input plus a standalone RmlUi/Vulkan-PS5 screen.
5. Extract a PS5-native emulation session from `yuzu_cmd` and Android lifecycle
   behavior, then boot the first homebrew application.
